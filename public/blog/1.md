# Why I Built a Portfolio Site 

I believe all developers need a portfolio website to properly display their skills and projects. A lot can be said of a person just by looking at their portfolio website.
When I decided to create my personal portfolio website, I wanted something that would not only showcase my work but also demonstrate my coding abilities. I decided to use React as it is an industry-wide used technology, and I was already comfortable using it from experience with past projects.

## Vision for my Portfolio Site

When planning my website, I knew I did not just want to code a simple static vanilla HTML website as I wanted it to be engaging. In order to do that, I needed to use a techstack that could handle the following:
- showcasing my education and experiences in an interactive and modern way
- adapt seamlessly to different device sizes
- include a blog to document my journey
- smooth animations and transitions 

## Tech Stack 

For this project, I used a selection of React based technologies:
- Styled Components for writing CSS directly in JavaScript
- Framer Motion for creating smooth animations
- React Router for handling navigation without page reloads
- React Swipeable for touch gestures on mobile

## Building Interactive Education and Experience Cards

The swipeable cards on the Education and Experience pages are one of the standout features of the portfolio. Here is how it was implemented:

```
const TabsContainer = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
  overflow-x: auto;
  scrollbar-width: none;
  
  &::-webkit-scrollbar {
    display: none;
  }
`;

const CardContainer = styled(motion.div)`
  width: 100%;
  background: white;
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
  
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    width: calc(100% + 20px);
    margin-left: -10px;
    margin-right: -10px;
  }
`;
```

And I used Framer Motion for the smooth transitions between the cards:

```
<AnimatePresence mode="wait">
  <CardContainer
    key={activeTab}
    initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 50 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
    exit={{ opacity: 0, x: -50 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.3, ease: "easeOut" }}
  >
  </CardContainer>
</AnimatePresence>
```

## The Navigation Bar

For mobile users, I created a slide-in navigation menu with clean animations and transitions:

```
const MobileNavOverlay = styled(motion.div)`
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  z-index: 1001;
`;

const MobileNavWrapper = styled(motion.div)`
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 75%;
  max-width: 320px;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  z-index: 1002;
  box-shadow: -5px 0 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  padding: 1.5rem;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;

```

## The Blog System

Instead of setting up a backend for the blogs, I decided to implement a simple but effective blog system using Markdown. This lets me write blog posts in Markdown, with metadata like title, date, image. 

```
const parseFrontMatter = (content) => {
  const frontMatterRegex = /^---\r?\n([\s\S]*?)\r?\n---/;
  const match = frontMatterRegex.exec(content);
  
  if (!match) {
    return { data: {}, content: content };
  }
  
  const frontMatter = match[1];
  const restContent = content.replace(match[0], '');
  
  const data = {};
  frontMatter.split('\n').forEach(item => {
    const [key, ...valueParts] = item.split(':');
    if (key && valueParts.length) {
      data[key.trim()] = valueParts.join(':').trim();
    }
  });
  
  return { data, content: restContent };
};
```

## Mobile Responsiveness 

Making the website work well on mobile was one of my biggest challenges. The swipeable cards especially caused issues as the whole page was sliding around on touch devices. I solved this problem using the ```touch-action``` CSS property.

```
const EducationContainer = styled.div`
  position: relative;
  touch-action: pan-y; /* Allow vertical scrolling but not horizontal */
`;

const swipeHandlers = useSwipeable({
  onSwipedLeft: () => navigateNext(),
  onSwipedRight: () => navigatePrev(),
  preventDefaultTouchmoveEvent: true,
  delta: 50,  // Minimum swipe distance
  swipeDuration: 500  // Allow more time to complete a swipe
});
```

## What I learned 

1. Test on real devices instead of emulators as some errors and bugs are not caught by the emulator
2. Scaling up is easier than scaling down so code for mobile first, then for pc
3. Optimizing performance is important as animations can cause lag if not correctly implemented


## Conclusion

Building this portfolio and deploying it has been a good learning experience. It helped me improve my React skills, but I also got a deeper understanding of responsive design, and animations.
The nice thing about portfolios is that they're never truly finished, and they evolve as you grow as a developer. I am excited to continue refining and improving it.
