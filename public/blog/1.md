# How I Built My Portfolio Site with React

When I decided to create my personal portfolio website, I wanted something that would not only showcase my work but also demonstrate my coding abilities. React was the obvious choice due to its component-based architecture and wide adoption in the industry.

## Planning the Structure

I started by planning out the main sections:
- A home page with a brief introduction
- Experience section to showcase my internships
- Education section detailing my academic background
- A blog to share my thoughts and learning experiences

## Component Architecture

I organized my components into reusable pieces:
- Header with navigation
- Home component with animated text highlights
- Experience and Education components with tab-based navigation
- Blog system with Markdown support for easy content creation

## Styling Approach

For styling, I chose styled-components because:
1. It allows for component-scoped CSS
2. Supports theme-based styling for dark/light mode
3. Makes responsive design more manageable with props

## Challenges and Solutions

The biggest challenge was creating smooth transitions between pages. I solved this using Framer Motion for page transitions, which provides a more polished user experience.
