# My Experience at Queen Mary University

Starting university is always a significant life transition, and my experience at Queen Mary University of London has been both challenging and rewarding.

## Academic Environment

The Computer Science program at Queen Mary's has exceeded my expectations. The curriculum strikes a good balance between theoretical foundations and practical applications. Some of my favorite modules so far include:

- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Software Engineering
- Database Systems

## Student Community

One of the highlights has been the diverse and inclusive student community. Coming from a multicultural background myself, I've appreciated the opportunity to work with students from all over the world.

## Tech Innovation Lab

I was fortunate to be selected for the university's tech innovation lab, where we work on cutting-edge projects with real-world applications. Currently, I'm part of a team developing natural language processing solutions for healthcare applications.

## Future Goals

As I continue my studies, I'm particularly looking forward to specializing in machine learning and artificial intelligence in my upper years. The university offers excellent research opportunities in these fields, which align perfectly with my career aspirations.
